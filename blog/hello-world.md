# Hello, World

*Published: 2024-01-01*

Welcome to my digital garden. This terminal interface serves as both my portfolio and a playground for cryptographic experiments.

## Why a Terminal?

As someone who spends most of their time in the command line, it felt natural to present my work in this format. There's something beautiful about the simplicity and efficiency of text-based interfaces.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Research**: My academic work on zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic protocols
- **Projects**: Open-source tools and experiments
- **Blog**: Thoughts on cryptography, security, and the future of privacy

Feel free to explore using the standard Unix commands. Type `help` if you get lost.
