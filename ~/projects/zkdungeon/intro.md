# zkDungeon

zkDungeon is a **verifiable roguelike RPG** — a deterministic world where every turn can be proven valid, yet not all truths are visible.

Built on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), zkDungeon ensures that every action, roll, and AI move followed the rules **without revealing** hidden information.
The result is a game that's both **honest and mysterious** — fair because it's provable, alive because it's systemic.

At its core, zkDungeon explores how **games can become transparent systems of truth** rather than opaque entertainment products.
Each world is procedural, deterministic, and shaped by interacting systems rather than scripts.
Your choices — lighting a torch, sparing an enemy, sealing a door — ripple through the rule system to form emergent stories that feel inevitable, not authored.

> *Fairness without authority. Secrecy without deceit.*
